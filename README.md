TOOLL.io is a new multi-purpose application for creating interactive 3D content and animations. It combines the best aspects of animation, compositing, and coding into a lightweight and intuitive UI. Your designs can be shared as executable, rendered to movies or as live visuals driven by sound, midi-controllers, or sensors.
